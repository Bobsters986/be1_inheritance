# Inheritance

This repository is meant to be used in conjunction with the [lesson on Inheritance](https://backend.turing.edu/module1/lessons/inheritance) at [Turing](https://turing.edu).


## How to Use

Starting with the `lesson_example` folder, read the `README.md` file and follow its instructions. Then, try building more classes and synthesize what you've learned in the `exercise_1` folder.

In the `lesson_example` folder, if you want to see a finished version of the scenarios explored, there is a branch available for this purpose called `lesson_completed`:
```
git fetch
git branch # => lesson_completed, *main
git checkout lesson_completed
```
In that branch, there are comments and questions for you to answer as you explore the example.
